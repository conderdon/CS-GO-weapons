<h5>The first news about the development of the game appeared along with the official announcement - on August 12, 2011 . The rumors that the company Valve's , responsible for a series of games Counter-Strike , is developing a new part of the game (the latter at that time the main game of the series, not counting the separate versions aimed at an Asian audience was Counter-Strike: Source 2004 ) spread several days earlier [5] [6] .

In the announcement of the game, it was reported that the developers promise to keep the basics of the gameplay of the "classic" version of the game - Counter-Strike 1.6 , as well as add new maps for multiplayer battles (among which there will be remakes of old maps with improved graphics), models of fighters and weapons.
